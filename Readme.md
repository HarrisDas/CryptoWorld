## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) for asynchronous.
- JetPack
  - LiveData - notify domain layer data to views.
  - Lifecycle - dispose of observing data when lifecycle state changes.
  - ViewModel - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
  - Hilt for dependency injection.
  - Navigation - navigation between compose UI screens.
  - Compose - provides beautiful UI based on [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
  - KTX - Provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack, Android platform, and other APIs.
  - [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
  - [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - logging.
  - [Material-Components](https://material.io/blog/jetpack-compose-beta) - Material design using Compose.

## Open API

CryptoWorld using the [Coin Layer API](https://coinlayer.com/documentation) for constructing RESTful API.<br>
CoinLayer API provides a RESTful API interface that provides all the details of crypto currencies.
You will need to provide the ***API_KEY*** in the ***app/build.gradle*** file to use the restful api

## Mock API Layer
- You can use mock-api branch to use the app without providing the ***API_KEY***
